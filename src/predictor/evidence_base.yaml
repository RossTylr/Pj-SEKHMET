        ACL injuries have one of the longest and most uncertain
        recovery trajectories in the Armed Forces.
        
        KEY FACTS:
        • About half of personnel return to unrestricted duty
        • Recovery typically takes 9 months, but ranges 6-12 months
        • Younger personnel (<25) face higher re-injury risk (~23%)
        • Returning to activity too early increases re-injury risk
        • A significant minority require permanent role restrictions
          or leave service, especially if re-injury occurs

        Lower back pain is the highest-volume MSKI in service
        and the leading cause of limited duty days.
        
        KEY FACTS:
        • Majority (60%) recover fully within 6 months
        • About 1 in 3 experience recurrence within a year
        • Mental health comorbidity dramatically worsens outcomes
        • Pain at time of RTD predicts subsequent injury
        • Supervised rehab reduces recovery time by ~25%

        Mild TBI is the "signature injury" of recent conflicts.
        Most recover quickly, but comorbidities complicate outcomes.
        
        KEY FACTS:
        • ~90% recover within 1-4 weeks from single uncomplicated mTBI
        • 10-20% develop persistent post-concussive symptoms
        • Military personnel have 3-4x higher PTSD rate after mTBI
          than civilians (48% vs 11-18%)
        • History of ≥3 concussions significantly reduces RTD likelihood
        • Medical discharge rates for TBI increased from 7% to 18%
          between 2002-2015
        • PTSD/depression comorbidity is the main driver of poor outcomes,
          not the brain injury itself

        PTSD recovery is highly variable. Many improve with treatment,
        but full remission is achieved in only around one-third.
        
        KEY FACTS:
        • Only 35% achieve full remission with treatment
        • 40% drop out of evidence-based treatment prematurely
        • Comorbidity (depression, substance use) is the norm
        • UK data shows 6% prevalence in regular forces, 11% in reservists
        • Medical discharge rates for PTSD increased from 16% to 34%
          between 2002-2015
        • Social support and stigma are major factors in help-seeking

        Shoulder injuries generally have favourable outcomes
        in young, active personnel when treated surgically.
        
        KEY FACTS:
        • ~80% return to unrestricted duty after surgery
        • Non-operative management carries 70% recurrence risk
          in high-demand roles
        • Recovery typically 4-9 months depending on procedure
        • Role restrictions may be needed temporarily

    sources: ["anderson_2023", "wiggins_2016"]
    stakeholder_explainer: |
      For every 10 years over age 25, recovery typically
      takes around 15% longer. This reflects slower tissue
      healing and reduced physiological reserve.

  age_young_reinjury:
    effect_type: "hazard_ratio"

    applies_to: ["knee_acl"]
    direction: "increases_reinjury"
    sources: ["wiggins_2016"]
    stakeholder_explainer: |
      Personnel under 25 have ~50% higher risk of re-injury
      after ACL reconstruction, likely due to higher activity
      levels and earlier return to demanding duties.

    recovery_modifier: null              # Insufficient evidence for recovery time
    sources: ["schram_2022"]
    evidence_note: |
      Strong evidence for higher injury INCIDENCE in females during training.
      Difference narrows post-training (RR 1.23).
      Insufficient evidence to confirm longer RECOVERY times - may be
      confounded by fitness levels and reporting behaviour.
    stakeholder_explainer: |
      Female personnel have higher injury rates during basic training
      (about 2x) but this gap narrows substantially after initial training.
      Fitness levels and reporting behaviour may explain much of the difference.
      Evidence for longer recovery times is limited.

    sources: ["wiggins_2016", "olivotto_2025"]
    stakeholder_explainer: |
      A previous injury to the same body region
      nearly doubles the risk of delayed recovery.
      Prior injuries may indicate underlying vulnerability
      or incomplete previous recovery.

      Personnel with 3 or more lifetime concussions have
      nearly double the risk of medical separation compared
      to those with a single concussion.

    direction: "accelerates_recovery"
    sources: ["olivotto_2025"]
    stakeholder_explainer: |
      Supervised rehabilitation reduces recovery time
      by approximately 25% compared with self-directed care.
      This effect is consistent across MSKI types.

    sources: ["anderson_2023"]
    stakeholder_explainer: |
      Delaying ACL surgery beyond 6 months is associated
      with ~35% higher failure rates (revision surgery or
      knee-related medical separation).

  # ----------------------------------------------------------
  # COMORBIDITY FACTORS
  # ----------------------------------------------------------

  mental_health_comorbidity:
    effect_type: "risk_ratio"
    rr: 6.0

    sources: ["olivotto_2025", "kcmhr_2024", "tbicohe_2023"]
    evidence_note: "Wide CI reflects heterogeneity in definitions"
    stakeholder_explainer: |
      Co-existing mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, PTSD)
      dramatically increase the risk of prolonged disability.
      This is the single strongest predictor of poor MSKI outcomes
      and the main driver of persistent symptoms after mTBI.

  ptsd_comorbidity_mtbi:
    effect_type: "prevalence_modifier"
    prevalence_military: 0.482           # 48.2%
    prevalence_civilian: 0.15            # 11-18.6%
    applies_to: ["mtbi"]
    impact: |
      When PTSD co-occurs with mTBI, symptoms are more severe
      and persistent. PTSD symptoms often drive disability
      more than the brain injury itself.
    sources: ["tbicohe_2023"]
    stakeholder_explainer: |
      Nearly half of military personnel with mTBI also have PTSD,
      compared to only 15% of civilians. When both conditions
      are present, recovery is significantly more complex.

  # ----------------------------------------------------------
  # BEHAVIOURAL FACTORS
  # ----------------------------------------------------------

  smoking:
    effect_type: "hazard_ratio"
    hr: 1.43

    direction: "delays_recovery"
    outcome: "surgical_failure"
    sources: ["anderson_2023"]
    stakeholder_explainer: |
      Smoking is associated with poorer healing and ~40%
      higher failure rates after musculoskeletal surgery.
      Smoking cessation should be encouraged pre-operatively.

  # OCCUPATIONAL FACTORS

    direction: "delays_rtd"
    evidence_grade: "Low"
    evidence_note: "Expert estimate pending calibration"
    sources: ["expert_estimate"]
    stakeholder_explainer: |
      Personnel in physically demanding roles (Infantry,
      Royal Marines, Para) face longer RTD times due to
      higher fitness thresholds required for occupational clearance.
      They may achieve Return to Fitness but not Return to Duty.
